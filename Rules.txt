# Meme Battles: Official Rules

## Core Concept
Meme Battles is a strategic card game where players battle using iconic meme characters, each with unique abilities and stats. Win by either defeating your opponent's Meme Lord (main character) or by achieving maximum Viral Status (victory points).

## Card Types

### Meme Lords (Your Main Character)
- Starts with 20 HP
- Can use one Action per turn
- Special ability unique to each Meme Lord
- Examples:
  - Gigachad: Once per game, can flex to become immune to damage for one turn
  - Doge: Much wow ability allows drawing an extra card each turn
  - Pepe: Can "feels bad man" to reverse any attack once per game

### Meme Cards (Your Battle Cards)
Each card has:
- Attack Power (0-10)
- Defense (0-10)
- Clout Level (1-3 stars, like rarity)
- Special Effect
- Element Type (more on this below)

## Element Types
- **Wholesome** (üíñ): Good against Toxic, weak to Cursed
- **Toxic** (‚ò¢Ô∏è): Good against Dank, weak to Wholesome
- **Dank** (üî•): Good against Cursed, weak to Toxic
- **Cursed** (üëª): Good against Wholesome, weak to Dank

Element advantages deal +2 damage, disadvantages deal -1 damage.
